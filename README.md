# NASA E-commerce Project

NASA E-commerce group project

## Description

Welcome to the NASA Ecommerce Project! This project is a culmination of the efforts of students from the RS School, driven by a shared passion for space exploration and technology.

At its core, the NASA Ecommerce Project aims to serve as a hub for space enthusiasts, providing them with a seamless platform to explore and purchase merchandise related to NASA missions, space exploration, and astronomy. Whether you're a seasoned astronomer, a devoted fan of space exploration, or simply someone with a curiosity about the cosmos, our platform is designed to cater to your needs and interests.

One of the key features of our platform is its user-friendly interface, designed to provide an intuitive browsing and shopping experience. Users can easily navigate through categories, search for specific items using keywords or mission names, and explore detailed product descriptions and images before making a purchase. 

In addition to its ecommerce functionalities, the NASA Ecommerce Project also offers users the opportunity to create accounts, enabling them to track their order history. We welcome feedback from our users and actively seek to incorporate new features and enhancements to make the NASA Ecommerce Project even better.
